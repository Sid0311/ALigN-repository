	This directory contains the code of quantization schemes for our papers, 
	"ALigN: A Highly Accurate Adaptive Layerwise Log_2_Lead Quantization of Pre-trained Neural Networks", Ieee Access, 2020.
	and "L2L: A Highly Accurate Log_2_Lead Quantization of Pre-trained Neural Networks", Design, Automation & Test in Europe Conference & Exhibition, 2020
	
	This directory contains the following four folders:

	1.	Quantization
	
	This folder contains the different quantization function of ALigN and L2L techniques
	
	2.	AlexNet 
	
	This folder contains Quantization of AlexNet network using proposed techniques with Imagenet validation dataset
	
	3.	VGGNET 
	
	This folder contains Quantization of VGG-16 network using proposed techniques with Imagenet validation dataset
	
	4.	Resnet
	
	This folder contains Quantization of Resnet18 network using proposed techniques with Imagenet validation dataset
	
	5.      FCN_image_segmentation
	
	This folder contains Quantization of FCN8 network using proposed techniques for image segmentation with PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset
   	
        **Execution and data related instruction are in folders
	ALigN and L2L techniques can be used for other deep neural networks and datasets
